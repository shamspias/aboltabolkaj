# Aboltabolkaj

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of various AI-related projects, experiments, and implementations. It includes reinforcement learning projects, basic AI models, and other machine learning explorations. The goal is to provide structured implementations of different AI techniques, ranging from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics.

## Projects
Below are some of the projects included in this repository:

### Reinforcement Learning Projects
- **Snake Game using Deep Q-Learning (`snake_game_dqn`)**: Implementation of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train an AI agent to play Snake.
- **Snake Game using Tabular Q-Learning (`snake_game_tabular_q_earning`)**: A classic Q-learning approach for training an AI agent in the Snake game.
- More reinforcement learning projects to be added soon.

### Other AI Projects
This repository will also contain various AI-related projects, including:
- **Basic AI Implementations**: Fundamental AI techniques such as search algorithms, pathfinding, and simple ML models.
- **Computer Vision**: Implementations of image processing, object detection, and classification models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Projects related to text generation, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Random AI Experiments**: Miscellaneous projects exploring new AI concepts and frameworks.
